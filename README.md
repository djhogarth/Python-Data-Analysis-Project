# Python-Data-Analysis-Project

Project Scenario:

I role play as a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust wants to start investing in Residential real estate and has
tasked me with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I analyze and predict housing prices
using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms and number of floors. Data visualizations are also generated to find outliers in the data.
